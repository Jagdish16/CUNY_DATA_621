## Assignment Objective

Build a multiple linear regression model on the Money Ball training data to predict the number of wins for the team. You can
only use the variables given to you (or variables that you derive from the variables provided).


## 1. Data Exploration

*Describe the size and the variables in the moneyball training data set. Consider that too much detail will cause a
manager to lose interest while too little detail will make the manager consider that you arenâ€™t doing your job.*

### Dataset

Each record in the in the Money Ball training dataset represents a professional baseball team from the years 1871 to 2006 inclusive. Each record
has the performance of the team for the given year, with all of the statistics adjusted to match the performance of a 162 game season.
Below is a short description of the variables of interest in the data set:

## 2. Data Preparation

*Describe how you have transformed the data by changing the original variables or creating new variables. If you did transform the data
or create new variables, discuss why you did this.*


## 3. Build Models

*Using the training data set, build at least three different multiple linear regression models, using different variables
(or the same variables with different transformations). Since we have not yet covered automated variable selection methods,
you should select the variables manually (unless you previously learned Forward or Stepwise selection, etc.). Since you manually
selected a variable for inclusion into the model or exclusion into the model, indicate why this was done.*


## 4. Select Models

*Decide on the criteria for selecting the best multiple linear regression model. Will you select a model with slightly
worse performance if it makes more sense or is more parsimonious? Discuss why you selected your model.*

*For the multiple linear regression model, will you use a metric such as Adjusted R2, RMSE, etc.? Be sure to
explain how you can make inferences from the model, discuss multi-collinearity issues (if any), and discuss other
relevant model output. Using the training data set, evaluate the multiple linear regression model based on (a)
mean squared error, (b) R2, (c) F-statistic, and (d) residual plots. Make predictions using the evaluation data set.*

### Data Exploration

There are 466 different neighborhoods in a major city with indications of whether or
not they are above the median crime rate, with 13 variables that are related to location,
transportatioon,, environment, housing, and education. There is also no missing variables.

According to the correlation table, there are is a high correlation between the accessibility
to radial highwaays and the full-value propety tax rate per $10,000. Also the weighted 
means of distance to the five Boston employment centers is usually negativelly correlated
with the other variables.

The nitrogen oxide levels, age of homes, and accessibilty to radial highways is the most 
correlated to the target variable, which is if the crime rate is above the median.

According to the graphs, the distanace to the employment centers tends to be lower 
and right-skewed as well as the lwoer status of the population. Meanwhile, the age 
of homes tends to be left skewed.

```{r}
summary(crime_training)

# creates a list with the correlations and p values 
corr_data<- rcorr(as.matrix(crime_training))
corr_p <- round(corr_data$P,4)
# this takes the values and correlations and makes it into a 2 column dataframe
flattenCorrMatrix <- function(cormat, pmat) {
  ut <- upper.tri(cormat)
  data.frame(
    row = rownames(cormat)[row(cormat)[ut]],
    column = rownames(cormat)[col(cormat)[ut]],
    cor  =(cormat)[ut],
    p = pmat[ut]
    )
}
# sorted the pairs of correlations by their p value to show variables with the biggest
# relationships, with the p showing the significance value
sorted_cor <- flattenCorrMatrix(corr_data$r, corr_data$P) %>%
   arrange(desc(abs(cor)))

#the highest correlations in betwen variables
head(sorted_cor)

#correlations with only target variable
flattenCorrMatrix(corr_data$r, corr_data$P) %>%
  filter(column == "target") %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(cor)))

### Data Preparation

There is no missing values in the dataset so there is no need for imputations. Transformations to
the variables wouldd be applied during the model buidling, and can be transformations such as
log, square root, quadratic, inverse, etc.

### Model Building

#### Model 1

This model uses all the variables which acts as a guideline on which variables would need to 
included, excluded, or tranformed. `nox` has the greatest affect on the taregt but the coefficients 
do not make sense as the intercept is out of bounds.

```{r, fig.show = "hold", out.width="50%"}
model1 <- glm(target ~  ., family = "binomial", data = crime_training)

summary(model1)

plot(fitted(model1), resid(model1), col = "grey", pch = 20,
     xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Fitted versus Residuals")
abline(h = 0, col = "darkorange", lwd = 2)
qqnorm(resid(model1), main = "Normal Q-Q Plot", col = "darkgrey")
qqline(resid(model1), col = "dodgerblue", lwd = 2)
```

#### Model 2

- Log/sqrt was applied to `age` and `lstat` as they were skewed.
- `rm` was removed since it had a high p  value.

```{r, fig.show = "hold", out.width="50%"}
model2 <- glm(target ~ zn + indus + chas + nox +  sqrt(age) + dis + rad + tax + ptratio + 
                sqrt(lstat) + medv, family = "binomial", data = crime_training)

summary(model2)

plot(fitted(model1), resid(model1), col = "grey", pch = 20,
     xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Fitted versus Residuals")
abline(h = 0, col = "darkorange", lwd = 2)
qqnorm(resid(model1), main = "Normal Q-Q Plot", col = "darkgrey")
qqline(resid(model1), col = "dodgerblue", lwd = 2)
```

#### Model 3 

- Log/sqrt was applied to `age` and `stat` as they were skewed.
- `rm` was removed since it had a high p  value.
- `lstat` was removed due to high p value
- ratio of `rad`/`tax`, the full value propety tax value squared per index of accessibility to radial highways
- `indus` was removed 
```{r, fig.show = "hold", out.width="50%"}
model3 <- glm(target ~ zn  + chas + nox +  sqrt(age) + dis + rad + tax + ptratio + 
                 medv + I(rad/tax^2), family = "binomial", data = crime_training)

summary(model3)

plot(fitted(model1), resid(model1), col = "grey", pch = 20,
     xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Fitted versus Residuals")
abline(h = 0, col = "darkorange", lwd = 2)
qqnorm(resid(model1), main = "Normal Q-Q Plot", col = "darkgrey")
qqline(resid(model1), col = "dodgerblue", lwd = 2)
```
